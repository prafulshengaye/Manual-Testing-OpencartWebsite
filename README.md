 Expense Tracker Application
 Introduction

The Expense Tracker Application is designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking expenses across various categories. The core functionality includes adding expenses, categorizing them, setting budgets, and generating detailed reports. This application aims to simplify personal finance management by providing a comprehensive and easy-to-use solution for monitoring and controlling spending.

 Project Type

Backend

 Deployed App

Since this project is a backend-focused application, the deployment links would be:

- Backend: https://deployed-site.expensetracker.com
- Database: Connected via MongoDB (or other database service).

(If you have a frontend component, you would include the link here as well.)

 Features

- *Add New Expenses: Users can add expenses specifying the amount, category, and description.
- *Categorize Expenses: Automatically groups expenses by category for easy tracking.
- *Set and Track Budgets: Users can set a budget and monitor their spending against it.
- *Generate Reports: Generate monthly and yearly expense reports to see detailed spending patterns.

Design Decisions or Assumptions

- *Expense Categorization: Categories are predefined and fixed to simplify tracking and reporting.
- *Budget Tracking: The budget is set globally, rather than per category, to allow for a broad overview of spending.
- *Date Handling:Expenses are timestamped when added, and reports are generated based on these timestamps.
